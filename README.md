# Python Slack Templates

Using Flask and Python

# Purpose


The primary purpose of this project is to improve my programming skills in various languages (I will be doing this in other languages commonly used in integrations) while improving my ability to write good documentation. 

# Project


The project will focus on providing Python templates when creating Slack applications and Bots. In it's most ideal state, you will be able to copy-paste code depending on what type of task you want your application to accomplish. This project will be using Flask and is best utilized by beginner level developers or scripters that want to get a custom slack application running. 

Note: Basic knowledge of web frameworks and REST API's is helpful but not required. This documentation will assume no prior knowledge of Frameworks or API requests.

# Dependencies


This project will use the following Dependencies:

> <sub>* Flask

> <sub>* Requests

# How to use


This documentation will be used as a tutorial with a table of contents for each section of the code (very similar to API documentation). The project will use minimum dependencies to get the code working and the rest is for the developer to fill in the blanks. 

If you are making a small Slack Application from scratch, you should be able to use this README as a tutorial. The README is organized as such to be able to walk you through creating a Slack application from the beginning to the end.
